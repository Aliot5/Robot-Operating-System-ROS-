### **Welcome to the Robot-Operating-System (ROS) **

In this project, we want to get to know ROS, so we start with an easy task and after that, we gradually make it harder.



## **1.Draw character with turtles!**

In this part I want you to draw some characters with turtlesim turtles. As you know turtlesim is the 2D simulator of ROS which gives you plenty of options to implement your ideas or develop current algorithms.

Now we want to display the letters G and * with turtles and as we can see, its form will be as follows:

## **2.Rotating the turtles!**

Now we want to make the turtles rotate around themselves at the same time.

In this part, we want to rotate the turtles together at the same time, for this we need the help of Twist, which can be used to rotate the turtle at the desired speed and direction. That we have rotated the turtles in relation to the z axis.

The results will be as follows:

## **BONUS!!**

In the bonus part we want to makes it possible to use the arrow keys to move the first displayed letter in the turtlesim playground.

In our position we want to moving forward and backward by up and down arrow keys and rotate clock wise and counter clock wise by right and left arrow keys.

The results will be as follows:

## **3.Launch files**

Now we can code a launch file that run the other codes respectively, for example this launcher file run a turtlesim at first after that make letter by its code and then rotate turtles in there place.
