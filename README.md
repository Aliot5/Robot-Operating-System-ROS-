### **Welcome to the Robot-Operating-System (ROS) Project**

In this project, we want to get to know ROS, so we start with an easy task and after that, we gradually make it harder.



## **1.Draw character with turtles!**

In this part I want you to draw some characters with turtlesim turtles. As you know turtlesim is the 2D simulator of ROS which gives you plenty of options to implement your ideas or develop current algorithms.

Now we want to display the letters G and * with turtles and as we can see, its form will be as follows:
